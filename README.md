HOW TO INSTALL

on linux, install maven apache, jdk and run at the project root:

mvn package or mvn clean package for rebuilding 

on windows, install scoop, jdk and the maven zip file, then run:

scoop search maven //at the directory in which you installed the maven zip file

then via command line run: mvn package or mvn clean package for rebuilding 

P.S: rebuilding is only advised for making changes to the source code, in which case, this project is completely open source
P.S2: also remember to set the JAVA_PATH and environment variables in windows
